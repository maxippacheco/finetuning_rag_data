# Fine-Tuning RAG Data and Human Feedback

## Introduction

This project demonstrates the strategic use of fine-tuning for specific types of RAG data. It highlights the distinction between dynamic data requiring frequent updates and static data suitable for parametric storage within an LLM's weights.

## Key Concepts

* **Dynamic RAG Data:**  Data that changes frequently and isn't ideal for fine-tuning.
* **Static RAG Data:** Stable data well-suited for fine-tuning and integration into an LLM.
* **Fine-tuning:** The process of adapting a pre-trained LLM to a specific task or dataset.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preparation:** The SciQ dataset, containing science questions, answers, and explanations, was chosen for its stability and relevance to fine-tuning. This dataset implicitly represents a form of human feedback, potentially derived from evaluating generative AI outputs.

2. **Data Conversion:** The dataset was transformed into a JSON Lines (JSONL) file containing prompts and completions, adhering to OpenAI's guidelines. This format aligns with completion models like GPT-4o-mini.

3. **Fine-tuning:** The cost-effective GPT-4o-mini model was fine-tuned using the prepared JSONL data.

4. **Evaluation:** The fine-tuned model's performance was assessed, and the outputs were deemed satisfactory. Further analysis of the model's metrics was conducted using the OpenAI metrics interface.
